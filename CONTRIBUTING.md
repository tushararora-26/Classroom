### Setup guidelines 🪜

Follow these steps to setup Classroom on your local machine

1. [Fork](https://github.com/Ratangulati/Classroom.git) the project
2. Clone the project to run on your local machine using the following command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/Classroom.git
   ```

3. Get into the root directory

   ```sh
   cd Classroom
   ```

4. Install all dependencies by running

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

5. Create your branch

   ```sh
   git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
   ```

6. Run and view the application on localhost

   ```sh
    npm start
   ```

> **P.S**: If you have `docker` installed in your system, you can follow these steps to set up the environment:
>
> 1. After forking and cloning the repo(as mentioned above), get into the project directory:
>
> ```bash
> cd Classroom/
> ```
>
> 2. Start the docker container with:
>
> ```bash
> docker-compose up
> ```
>
> 3. Now start adding your changes.
>    **Note:** You don't need to restart the container again and again after starting it once, because the changes you make will reflect in the container instantly.

7. Make your changes before staging them.

8. Stage your changes

   ```sh
   git add <filename>
   ```

9. Commit your changes

   ```sh
   git commit -m "<your-commit-message>"
